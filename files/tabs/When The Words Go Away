When the Words Go Away – Trey Anastasio
Capo 3

C                 G           C           		G
The snows coming faster, my view around the bend
C	                G		            D
A beautiful valley tucked into a glen
		            C		                   Em
Can barely be seen, but where is the wind?
		          D		                      C
Where is the noise, where our voices again?

C		          G	          C	            G
Locked in a capsule, for time without end
C		          G		                      D
Watching the world through a pane or a lens
		                C		                    Em
There’s nothing to fear when there’s nobody near
		D		                                    C
But silence can kill and there’s lots of it here

F		            C		                  G		                D
We decided to part, each make a new start, but I didn’t know
F			                  C		            G		                D
What you take when you go, now I’m beholden to silence not golden
		                  C		                  G
There’s nothing to say, when the words go away

C		            G	      C	        G
Embraced isolation, is never a choice
C		              G		                  D
I long for the comfort I get from your voice
		            C		                        Em
The vacuum of sound that you leave when you go
		                D		                C
Is spreading the silence around us like snow

F		            C		                  G		                D
We decided to part, each make a new start, but I didn’t know
F			                  C		          G		                    D
What you take when you go, now I’m beholden to silence not golden
		                C		                  G
There’s nothing to say, when the words go away

G		              C
When the words go away
When the words go away
When the words go away
When the words go away
